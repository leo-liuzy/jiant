### Documentation source

This folder contains `jiant`'s documentation source code. The `jiant` project uses [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) to build these docs, and [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) to version, deploy, and host these docs. `jiants`'s latest published documentation is hosted [here](https://jiant-jiant.readthedocs-hosted.com/_/sharing/1rwldrolf0s931s2dz5x260owr).

##### Build and view the `jiant` documentation locally:
1. run `make clean html` in this directory.
2. open `jiant/docs/_build/html/index.html` in your browser.
